So a new pack's been spoiled. There's a sweet new fracter there that looks like it could be good...

...but does it stand up against the incredible [Corroder](https://netrunnerdb.com/en/card/01007)?

This tool automates calculation of icebreaking costs. The base class works for "generic" cards (those with little or no unique rules text) but can be extended to support a wide range of rules. For example, [index.py](https://github.com/ashbc/pybreak/blob/165ba363bd784b6bb9154c03acc798ecd1f086c6/index.py#L157) shows a hack for advanceable ice, and a less hacky implementation of variable cost/strength of ICE, based on [a silly custom card I came up with](https://scontent.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t34.0-12/18337296_1700113830004849_811033531_n.png?oh=c02427db1366bb13726a98b7707cd531&oe=5914181C).
